% dbSearch.m -- This file is part of 2DKD.
% 
% This script is responsible for searching the output of 'dbIndex' for 
% descriptors similar to the ones corresponding the query. A query image is 
% supplied as input, then 'compDesc' is run on the query, producing descriptors 
% for it, and then the matrix from 'dbIndex' is sorted by Euclidean distance of 
% descriptors to the new ones obtained, giving a ranked list of the most similar
% regions to the query from all subimages in the database.
% 
% See the references [1] and [2] for details.
