% This script computes the two-dimensional Krawtchouk descriptors (2DKD) of 
% order up to 3. The inputs are an image density function f(x,y) and the 
% point-of-interest location (xp,yp). The output vector V contains the six 
% invariant local descriptors.
% 
% See the references [1] and [2] for details.
